    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <p>this is my <i>first</i> test website.<br>
     It will be about cats<br>
     <a href="IMG_0351.jpg"><img src="IMG_0351.jpg" width="10%" height="25%"></a>
    the picture you see here are my two cats<br>
    the cat on the left is named shadow and the cat on the right is named spots <i>but my family often calls him spozzy because one of our old cats was named spaz and we would call it spazzy</i></p>
