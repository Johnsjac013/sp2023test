      <h1>hello world</h1>
      this is my <i>first</i> test website.<br>
      It will be about cats<br>
    <a href="IMG_0351.jpg"><img src="IMG_0351.jpg" width="300" height="325"></a><br>
      the picture you see here are my two cats<br>
      the cat on the left is named shadow and the cat on the right is named spots <i>but my family often calls him spozzy because one of our old cats was named spaz and we would call it spazzy</i><br>
      cats are mammals and are carnivores. cats are some of the oldest domesticated pets and were very important to many cultures.<br> they were theriorized to be domesticated over 10,000 years ago by people in the middle east<br>
