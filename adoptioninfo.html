    <h3>Heres some info about adoption</h3>
    <p>Adopting a cat can be a big responisibility you need to make sure having a cat is right for you you will need to take care of it and love it you will need to feed it and give it water if you think you can handle that responsibility you should consider adopting a cat adopting a cat can be a proccess but overall it cheaper than getting a cat from a breeder and its more sustainable if you can take care of a cat who needs a home instead of being out on the street i recomend getting a black cat because they are sometimes ignored and thrown out because there is an old superstiton about them being bad luck but their not bad luck their just cute
