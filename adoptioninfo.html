    <h1>Heres some info about adoption</h1>
    <p>Adopting a cat can be a big responisibility you need to make sure having a cat is right for you you will need to take care of it and love it you will need to feed it and give it water if you think you can handle that responsibility you should consider adopting a cat adopting a cat can be a proccess but overall it cheaper than getting a cat from a breeder and its more sustainable if you can take care of a cat who needs a home instead of being out on the street I recomend getting a black cat because they are sometimes ignored and thrown out because there is an old superstiton about them being bad luck but their not bad luck their just cute You can find your nearest adoption center by looking up animal shelter on google with your location the animal shelters website may have photos and info on the animals they have there that you can adopt so please drive on down to your nearest shelter and find a cat to adopt or if you find a cat on the street bring it to a shelter and they will help it</p>
    <p>Before you go out and adopt a cat your gonna need a few things first such as a box for cat litter and cat litter you will also need cat food I would recomend getting dry and wet food and seeing which your cat likes more or having a combination of both for both of their respective benefits you will probablly want some toys for your cat and a scratching post of some kind you will probablly want a lint roller because some cat shed quite a bit and you might not want cat hair on your clothes most cats are good at using the litterbox but if not you might want a floor or carpet spray to help clean up and some incentive to train them like treats</p>
